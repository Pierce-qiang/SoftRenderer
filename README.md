# SoftRenderer
Learning Software Rasterization 
# Plan
 - math lib
 - platform io
 - setup basic framework and draw basic triangle to verity
 - camera and verify rotate and drag
 - rasterize func
 - texture load
 - basic model, basic shader to handle data
 - complete pipeline including backface clipping, clipping space interpolate and clipping, larger z clipping    
 - fix bugs
--------------------------- current --------------------
 - load complex model and their resources
 - Blin-PhongShader and PBR shader
 - try TBB or any multi thread methods to speed up
